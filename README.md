# 🏏 IPL Winning Match Predictor

## 🚀 Project Overview

Thrilled to introduce my **IPL Winning Match Predictor**! This project leverages the power of **Streamlit** and **Logistic Regression** to offer accurate match forecasts based on historical data and key performance metrics. Whether you're a cricket enthusiast or a data science lover, experience the excitement of data-driven predictions in the world of the Indian Premier League.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive Web App**: Built using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for match prediction.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Utilizes logistic regression to predict the probability of a team winning based on historical match data.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Predict match outcomes using key performance metrics, including player stats, team form, and match conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the logistic regression model.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure


- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and the Streamlit app.
- `models/`: Saved logistic regression model for predictions.

## 🚀 How to Run
